The project Three-in-a-Row Game for the subject "Programming technologies", 2024. The author of the project is Daria 
Borzova, a 1st year student of the B05-311 MIPT group.

Three-in-a-Row is a genre of computer games. Games of this genre are characterized by the fact that their game world 
consists of a table or grid of elements, and the player's task is to manipulate the elements in such a way that the 
template combinations set by the game match, and after fulfilling the condition, the collected elements disappear.

At the moment, this project is the simplest Three-in-a-Row game, in which there is only one playing field, and the 
only template combinations are the Three-in-a-Row combination and the Three-in-a-Column combination. However, in the 
future I plan to develop this project, add levels, new combinations, and more.

Software Requirements:

- Language version: Java 8 or higher;
- Build System: Maven;
- Third-party libraries: not required, the standard library is sufficient;
